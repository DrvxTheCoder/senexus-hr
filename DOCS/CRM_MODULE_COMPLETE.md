# CRM Module - Basic Client CRUD Implementation ✅

## Summary

The CRM (Customer Relationship Management) module has been implemented with basic client management functionality. This allows you to create, view, update, and manage clients that can be assigned to employees in the HR module.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Client Management CRUD ✅

**Created Files:**
- `src/modules/crm/schemas/client-schema.ts` - Zod validation for client data
- `src/modules/crm/actions/client-actions.ts` - Complete server actions
- `src/modules/crm/pages/clients.tsx` - Full client management UI
- `src/modules/crm/config.ts` - Module configuration
- `src/modules/crm/pages/index.tsx` - CRM dashboard
- `src/modules/crm/pages/reports.tsx` - Reports placeholder

**Features:**
- ✅ Client list with search and status filters
- ✅ Stats dashboard (total, active, prospects, inactive)
- ✅ Create new clients with full form
- ✅ Update existing clients
- ✅ Soft delete (archive) clients
- ✅ Employee count per client
- ✅ Status management (ACTIVE, INACTIVE, PROSPECT, ARCHIVED)
- ✅ Complete client information (contact, tax number, industry, etc.)

### 2. Server Actions ✅

**Available Actions:**
```typescript
// Get all clients for a firm with filters
getClients(firmId, filters?: { status?, search? })

// Get single client with full details
getClient(clientId)

// Create new client
createClient(firmId, input)

// Update existing client
updateClient(clientId, input)

// Delete (archive) client
deleteClient(clientId)
```

**Security Features:**
- ✅ Authentication checks
- ✅ Authorization (ADMIN/OWNER/MANAGER can create/update)
- ✅ Firm access verification
- ✅ Audit logging for all mutations
- ✅ Soft delete to preserve data integrity
- ✅ Validation prevents deleting clients with assigned employees

### 3. Client Data Model

**Fields Available:**
- `name` - Client company name (required)
- `contactName` - Primary contact person
- `contactEmail` - Contact email
- `contactPhone` - Contact phone number
- `taxNumber` - Tax identification number
- `address` - Physical address
- `industry` - Business sector
- `tags` - Array of tags for categorization
- `status` - ACTIVE | INACTIVE | PROSPECT | ARCHIVED
- `contractStartDate` - Contract start date
- `contractEndDate` - Contract end date
- `notes` - Additional notes

**Relations:**
- `assignedEmployees` - Employees assigned to this client
- `contracts` - Contracts associated with this client
- `firmAssignments` - Multi-firm assignments (for holdings)
- `quarterlyReports` - Quarterly reports generated for this client

### 4. UI Components

**Client List Page:**
- Search by name, contact, tax number
- Filter by status (All, Active, Prospect, Inactive)
- Stats cards showing counts
- Table view with key information
- Employee count badge
- Edit action for each client

**Client Form Dialog:**

```

## How to Test

### 1. Navigate to CRM Module
```
/{firmSlug}/crm/clients
```

### 2. Create a Client
1. Click "Ajouter un client"
2. Fill in at minimum the required field: **Nom du client**
3. Optionally add contact info, tax number, industry, etc.
4. Select status (defaults to PROSPECT)
5. Click "Créer"

### 3. View Clients
- Should see the client in the table
- Stats cards update automatically
- Can search by name
- Can filter by status

### 4. Edit a Client
1. Click "Modifier" on any client
2. Update fields
3. Click "Mettre à jour"

### 5. Use with HR Module
Once you have clients:
1. Go to HR Employees module
2. When creating/editing an employee
3. Can assign them to a client from dropdown
4. Employee will show up in client's "Employés" count

## Integration with HR Module

The CRM and HR modules are now fully integrated:

**Client → Employee Assignment:**
- Employees can be assigned to clients
- `Employee.assignedClientId` links to `Client.id`
- Client page shows count of assigned employees
- Prevents deletion of clients with active employee assignments

**For Testing HR Module:**
1. Create a few test clients in CRM
2. When creating employees in HR, you can now assign them to these clients
3. This is required for complete employee records in interim staffing

## Module Configuration

The CRM module is registered with:
- **Slug**: `crm`
- **Base Path**: `/crm`
- **Permissions**: OWNER, ADMIN, MANAGER, STAFF
- **System Module**: No (can be installed/uninstalled)

**Routes:**
1. Dashboard - `/crm`
2. Clients - `/crm/clients` ✅ WORKING
3. Reports - `/crm/reports` (placeholder)

## Next Steps for CRM Enhancement

### Short Term:
1. **Client Detail Page** - Full view with tabs (employees, contracts, reports)
2. **Client Assignment History** - Track which employees worked for each client
3. **Import/Export** - Bulk client import from Excel/CSV

### Medium Term:
1. **Quarterly Reports** - Auto-generate ClientQuarterlyReport records
2. **Client Contracts** - Dedicated contract management per client
3. **Analytics Dashboard** - Client growth, revenue tracking

### Long Term:
1. **Multi-firm Client Assignment** - ClientFirmAssignment management
2. **Client Portal** - External access for clients to view their employees
3. **Integration with Accounting** - Invoice generation based on employee hours

## Permissions

- **OWNER/ADMIN**: Full access (create, update, delete)
- **MANAGER**: Can create and update, cannot delete
- **STAFF**: View only (can be adjusted in config.ts)
- **VIEWER**: View only

## Security & Compliance

✅ All actions include:
- Session authentication
- Firm access verification
- Role-based permissions
- Audit logging
- Soft delete (archive) instead of hard delete
- Prevents deletion if employees are assigned

## Known Limitations

1. **firmId Resolution**: Like HR module, needs implementation based on your session
2. **Client Portal**: Not yet implemented
3. **Reports**: Quarterly reports UI not yet built (database schema exists)
4. **Tags Management**: Tags field exists but no tag management UI yet

## Testing Checklist

## Summary

You now have a **working CRM module** with:
- ✅ Complete client CRUD
